# Data Structures And Algorithms in JavaScript

## Author: Gerald Addey

This repository serves as a platform for the implementation and documentation of various data structures and algorithms.

## Introduction:
The aim is to gain thorough undersnading of data structures and algorithm in javascript for efficient peoblem solving.

## Data Structures:
Data manipulation, a fundamental aspect of coding, revolves around managing values and their relationships. Data structures offer different ways of organizing data in computers, categorizing into primitive and non-primitive types.

## Complexity Analysis:
Understanding the efficiency of algorithms involves assessing time and space complexities, crucial measures in determining their performance.

## Memory:
Memory is likened to a canvas, finite and organized into bytes, each with a unique address. Memory blocks streamline data storage, aiding in efficient access and management.

## Pointers:
Variables storing memory addresses of other variables facilitate efficient data access in computers.

## Big O Notation:
Expressing algorithm runtime growth concerning input size helps gauge their efficiency. Different O notations categorize runtimes relative to input growth rates.

## Simplify Big O:
In simplifying Big O expressions, focus lies on the fastest-growing term as input size increases, disregarding less significant terms and coefficients.
